# hello-world
Beginner Project to store my Ideas
I'd like to contribute to folding@home to bring free science and accomplishments to everyone with my former BitCoin-Hardware which I can bring now to useful use.
Also I'd like to download additions to Ubuntu-Software which hasn't been implemented yet from others; at the moment for example how to address gpu-fan and better adjust to Load 
I hope I also can contribute some ideas for others also my programming knowledge and my endurance feels limited at the moment.
